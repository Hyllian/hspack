# hspack
Collection of slang shaders and presets fine tuned by me for a plug 'n play Retroarch/Libretro experience.

# How to use
Just put the '0-hspack' folder inside Retroarch 'shaders/shaders_slang' folder.

# License
Presets are public licensed. In case of shaders, each shader file has its license description inside it.

# Credits
To all original shader authors that are called by these presets and/or my shaders.
