# hspack
Collection of slang shaders and presets fine tuned by me for a plug 'n play Retroarch/Libretro experience.

# How to use
Just put the '0-hspack' folder inside Retroarch 'shaders/shaders_slang' folder.

# License
Mostly shaders are public licensed. For a detailed description, each file has its license inside it.
